# Redux Book List

Currently learning Readux with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) by Stephen Grinder. Used his [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) to set up the app.

This is the second basic app built with this course, and the first Redux app I build. 

### Getting Started

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
